## 📊 Feature Comparison: Before vs After

| Feature | Before | After | Status |
|---------|--------|-------|--------|
| Contract Addresses | Mock/Placeholder | Real Deployed | ✅ |
| User Registration | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Badge Tiers | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Quest System | ❌ Mock | ✅ Real | ✅ |
| Season Competitions | ❌ Mock | ✅ Real | ✅ |
| NFT Reputation | ❌ Mock | ✅ Real | ✅ |
| Partner Integration | ❌ | ✅ Real | ✅ |
| Dynamic Reward Rates | ❌ | ✅ Real | ✅ |
| Platform Fee System | ❌ | ✅ Real | ✅ |
| Leaderboard | ⚠️ Mock | ⚠️ Mock* | 🔄 |

*Leaderboard still uses mock data as it requires indexer/subgraph for production. This is documented as a known limitation.

## 🎓 Key Concepts

### Badge Tier System
Tiers automatically upgrade based on referral count:
- **Bronze** (0+ referrals): 5% + 2%
- **Silver** (5+ referrals): 10% + 4%
- **Gold** (15+ referrals): 15% + 6%
- **Platinum** (50+ referrals): 20% + 8%

### Platform Economics
- 15% platform fee on all actions (configurable)
- Remaining 85% distributed as referral rewards
- Treasury receives all platform fees

### Quest Progression
1. User completes referrals
2. Quest progress auto-updates
3. User claims rewards when complete
4. Rewards paid from contract balance

### Seasonal Competitions
1. Owner starts season with prize pool
2. User stats tracked separately per season
3. Season ends after duration
4. Owner distributes rewards to top performers
